## ‚ö°Ô∏è Powered by Base

Linka leverages [Base](https://base.org) as its primary onchain infrastructure, providing affordable and scalable transactions. Making onchain activity accessible to users regardless of prior crypto experience. However, while wallets and payments use Base, not all external flows (e.g., fiat on/off-ramp, vendor API integrations) are fully onchain.

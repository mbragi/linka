# Linka Pitch Deck

## The Conversational Onchain Marketplace

**Linka** transforms how people discover vendors, chat, and pay by bringing e-commerce into natural conversations across WhatsApp, Web, and Farcasterâ€”all powered by Base blockchain.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Why Linka Stands Out

### Built on Base for Real Impact
Linka leverages Base's fast, low-cost infrastructure to deliver custodial wallets that work seamlessly. Every user gets an automatically generated wallet with native crypto transactions, powered by Bread.africa's fiat on/off-ramp integration.

### Technical Excellence That Delivers
Our multi-channel conversational interface spans WhatsApp, Web, and Farcaster with NLU-powered chat via Wit.ai. Users can complete entire transaction flowsâ€”from vendor discovery to paymentâ€”entirely through natural conversation, backed by a modular MCP-first architecture.

### Revolutionary Approach to Commerce
We're pioneering the first conversational marketplace that eliminates traditional UI dependencies. Our channel-agnostic core ensures the same seamless experience whether you're chatting on WhatsApp, browsing the web, or engaging on Farcaster.

### Targeted for Maximum Impact
We're laser-focused on young professionals in emerging markets like Nigeria, where digital-first solutions are most needed. Our secondary audience includes small business vendors seeking modern payment solutions and crypto-curious users wanting frictionless fiat-to-crypto experiences.

### Testing a Bold Hypothesis
Our core belief is that people prefer conversational commerce over traditional e-commerce interfaces. We're measuring success through wallet activation rates, booking conversions, and cross-channel retention to validate this approach.

### Accessible to Everyone
No crypto knowledge requiredâ€”our custodial wallets handle all the complexity. Users interact through familiar platforms like WhatsApp and web chat, with GDPR-compliant onboarding that prioritizes consent and transparency.

### Remarkable Innovation
Linka delivers a complete marketplace experience through conversation, reaching users across three major communication channels while bringing onchain commerce to underserved regions through our innovative MCP-first architecture.

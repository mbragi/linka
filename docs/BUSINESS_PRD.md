# Linka: Business Product Requirements Document

**"Conversations that close onchain"**

---

## Executive Summary

Linka bridges the trust gap in social commerce by enabling secure, verifiable transactions directly within conversations on platforms like Farcaster, WhatsApp, and web chat. We solve the problem of fragmented discovery and untrustworthy transactions by combining AI-powered conversation with blockchain escrow, creating the first trust layer for Web3 social commerce.

**Target Market**: Global, with initial focus on crypto-native communities and African markets (Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa)

**Business Model**: Transaction fees (2.5% on escrows) + fiat on-ramp commissions + premium vendor subscriptions

**Projected Revenue**: $125K Year 1, $1.25M Year 2, $6.25M Year 3

## 1. The Problem

### Social Commerce is Broken

Imagine you're scrolling through Farcaster or Twitter and find something you want to buy. Someone offers a service, a product, or a deal. You chat, agree on terms, but then comes the hard part: actually paying.

**Today's reality:**
- No verifiable way to complete transactions from social platforms
- Deals rely on screenshots, DMs, and blind trust
- Users risk scams, delays, and zero accountability
- Payment happens off-platform, leaving no record
- Disputes require lengthy back-and-forth with no resolution mechanism
- AI assistants can recommend but can't execute verifiable payments

### The Trust Gap

**For Buyers:**
"Will I get what I paid for? What if they disappear with my money?"

**For Sellers:**
"Will they pay me after I deliver? What if they dispute the transaction?"

**For Everyone:**
"Why can't I just pay naturally within the conversation?"

### Why Current Solutions Fail

- **Payment Apps** (Venmo, Cash App): Great for friends, but no escrow protection
- **Escrow Services** (Escrow.com): Web2-only, slow, expensive, complex forms
- **Crypto Wallets** (MetaMask): No marketplace, requires technical knowledge
- **Social Platforms** (Farcaster, WhatsApp): Perfect for discovery, zero commerce tools

**The gap**: No one connects social discovery with verifiable, protected transactions.

## 2. The Solution

### Linka: Trust in Every Conversation

Linka is a conversational marketplace that lets people buy, sell, and transact naturally within their existing conversations. We remove the trust barrier through:

1. **AI-Powered Assistant**: Understands what you want and creates protected transactions automatically
2. **Blockchain Escrow**: Your money stays safe until delivery is confirmed
3. **Reputation System**: Transparent feedback creates accountability
4. **Multi-Platform**: Works on Farcaster, WhatsApp, Web, and more coming

### How It Works (Simplified)

**Instead of:**
1. See offer on Farcaster
2. Switch to WhatsApp/email
3. Send payment blindly
4. Hope for delivery
5. Dispute if something goes wrong

**Linka enables:**
1. See offer on Farcaster
2. Chat with Linka AI: "I want to buy this"
3. Escrow automatically created (money held safely)
4. Receive product/service
5. Approve release ("Looks good!")
6. Payment completes automatically
7. Both parties get reputation boost

### The Three Pillars

**1. Conversation-First**
- No complex forms or interfaces
- Natural language: "I want to buy a laptop for 2 ETH"
- AI handles all the technical details

**2. Trust Built-In**
- Every transaction uses escrow (money held until confirmed)
- On-chain reputation scores from past transactions
- Dispute resolution when needed

**3. Universal Access**
- Works wherever you chat (Farcaster, WhatsApp, Web, future platforms)
- Fiat or crypto, through our fiat on-ramp partnerships
- Simple onboarding, even for crypto beginners

## 6. Revenue Model

### Primary Revenue Streams

#### 1. Transaction Fees (Immediate)

**Model**: 2.5% platform fee on all escrow transactions

**Example:**
- User creates $500 escrow
- Platform fee: $12.50
- Seller receives: $487.50

**Revenue Projections:**
- Year 1: $5M volume × 2.5% = $125K revenue
- Year 2: $50M volume × 2.5% = $1.25M revenue
- Year 3: $250M volume × 2.5% = $6.25M revenue

**Why It Works:**
- Frictionless for users (automatic)
- Transparent pricing (no hidden fees)
- Aligned incentives (we succeed when transactions complete)
- Competitive with traditional payment processors

#### 2. Fiat On-Ramp Commission (6-12 months)

**Model**: Partnership revenue share with Bread.africa on fiat-to-crypto conversions

**Commission Rate**: 0.5-1% of conversion volume

**How It Works:**
- User wants to buy but only has fiat (naira, shillings, etc.)
- Linka provides fiat on-ramp via Bread.africa
- User converts fiat to crypto (ETH, stablecoins)
- Transaction completes on Linka
- Linka earns commission on conversion

**Revenue Projections:**
- Year 1: $10M fiat conversions × 0.5% = $50K (launch mid-year)
- Year 2: $100M fiat conversions × 0.5% = $500K
- Year 3: $400M fiat conversions × 0.5% = $2M

**Why It Matters:**
- Removes crypto barrier for mass market
- Creates additional revenue stream
- Expands addressable market beyond crypto-native users

#### 3. Premium Vendor Subscriptions (12-18 months)

**Model**: Tiered subscription for vendors wanting enhanced features

- Basic support

**Tier 2 - Professional ($99/month):**

- Year 3: 2,000 paid vendors × avg $100/month = $2.4M annual ($500K from launch)

**Target Adoption:**
- 10% of vendors upgrade to paid tiers

### Unit Economics

**Average Transaction:** $500

**Payback Period:** 1.2 months

## 9. Risk Analysis

- **Probability**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Multi-jurisdiction launch strategy, focus on compliant jurisdictions initially, legal advisory board

- **Mitigation**: Multiple RPC providers for blockchain access, fallback payment providers, monitoring and alerting systems
